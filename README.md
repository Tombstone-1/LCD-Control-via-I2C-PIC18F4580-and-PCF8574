# Project---PCF8574-with-PIC18F4580
Controlling 16x2 LCD using pcf8574 through I2C protocol with PIC18F4580. code on MPLAB X

Tool Used :
1 > MPLAB X IDE
2 > XC8 compilier
3 > Proteus for simulations

Notes :-
 code line 
```bash 
#define _XTAL_FREQ 4000000
```
 here 4 Mhz is selected for simulation purpose only but needs to be changed according to board crystal
